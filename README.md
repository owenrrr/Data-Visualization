# Data Visualization
```
- csv
- json             // original files
- fixed            // fixed data
- main.py         
- players_ranking.py     // examples of fixing data
- test.py          // csv to json && json to csv

```



***If you want to use it successfully, check out the players_ranking.py and rewrite the code that fit yours***



**Main Function:**

​	put the json files in the directory named 'json'. Specially, json only can have at most 4 keys.

​	I use the github project from <a href="https://github.com/Jannchie/Historical-ranking-data-visualization-based-on-d3.js">here</a> . Maybe you can visit his project , that will be better. 



***ps. This is just my homework project. It haven't done yet. Probably it will update***
